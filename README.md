# Map Files 
In this branch there are STATA ado and dta files for mapping all states in the United States. The ado files were not authored by me. The "spmmap"  files were used prior to the release of the "grmap" command in STATA 16. The "geo4xy.ado" file was written by Robert Picard (picard@netbox.com) and Michael Stepner (michael.stepner@utoronto.ca). For more details see: https://econpapers.repec.org/software/bocbocode/s457990.htm. The "Map.do" file follows the instructions proided by Picard and Stepner and produces a map of all U.S. states with no data.
